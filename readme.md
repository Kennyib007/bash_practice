# Bash Scripting Practice

Welcome to my Bash scripting practice repo! 🎉  
This is a collection of hands-on exercises and mini-scripts I wrote while refreshing my Bash knowledge — from the basics to more intermediate concepts.

## 🛠️ What’s inside?

This repo includes small, focused scripts and examples covering topics like:

- Variables and user input
- Conditional logic (`if`, `case`, etc.)
- Loops (`for`, `while`)
- Functions and return values
- Working with files and directories
- Arguments and parameter handling
- Basic automation scenarios
